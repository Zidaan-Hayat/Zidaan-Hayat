### Hello, I'm Zidaan, you can also call me Zee. I work on LLMs for dynamic knowledge base systems.
<br>

**In my student life,** I study at the [OTH Regensburg](https://www.oth-regensburg.de/), a student city in Bavaria ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª and should graduate in 2027.

**With my free will,** I work as a technician for a [theatre group](https://theatrewallay.com/) in Islamabad ðŸ‡µðŸ‡°, my home town.


> *I've spent less time feeling like my life is automated and more time trying to automate it.*
